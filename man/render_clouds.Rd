}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point.}

\item{altitude}{Altitude to place the overlay.}

\item{zscale}{Default `1`. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis. For example, if the elevation levels are in units
of 1 meter and the grid values are separated by 10 meters, `zscale` would be 10. Adjust the zscale down to exaggerate elevation features.}

\item{alpha}{Default `1`. Multiplies the layer's transparency by this factor. 0 is completely transparent.}

\item{triangulate}{Default `TRUE`. If a `heightmap` is passed, this will triangulate the height field for a smaller map.
Set this to `TRUE` if generating the model is slow, or moving it is choppy. Will also reduce the size
of 3D models saved to disk.}

\item{max_error}{Default `0.001`. Maximum allowable error when triangulating the height map,
when `triangulate = TRUE`. Increase this if you encounter problems with 3D performance, want
to decrease render time with `render_highquality()`, or need 
to save a smaller 3D OBJ file to disk with `save_obj()`,}

\item{max_tri}{Default `0`, which turns this setting off and uses `max_error`. 
Maximum number of triangles allowed with triangulating the
height map, when `triangulate = TRUE`. Increase this if you encounter problems with 3D performance, want
to decrease render time with `render_highquality()`, or need 
to save a smaller 3D OBJ file to disk with `save_obj()`,}

\item{verbose}{Default `TRUE`, if `interactive()`. Prints information about the mesh triangulation
if `triangulate = TRUE`.}

\item{clear_layers}{Default `FALSE`. Clears all existing floating layers on the visualization.}
}
\value{
Adds a 3D floating layer to the map. No return value.
}
\description{
Render a 3D floating cloud layer of the map.

Note: Underlying layers with transparency can cause rendering issues in rgl.
